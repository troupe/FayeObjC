I've begun work on an update to FayeObjC. I am also porting the source over to be ARC compatible, once this work is done I'll keep the current master around as a non-ARC branch for those that wish to use it.

# FayeObjC

A simple Objective-C client library for the Faye publish-subscribe messaging server. FayeObjC is implemented atop the SocketRocket Objective-C web socket library and will work on both Mac and iPhone projects.

# Mac Test Client

Included in the repository is a zipped release build of the FayeObjC Mac client.  This client allows you to test your Faye server, it connects over a websocket connection to the server specified and subscribes to the channel specified and will send messages via the server/channel it is connected to.

The messages are of the form { message: "some text" }

If you want to use the mac client to connect and test your faye server just unzip and start it on any mac.

The Mac client is available in the Downloads section of the repo - click "Downloads" to access it.

# Installation

TODO: Write up cocoapods installation instructions.

## Working with the library

Initialize a Client:

    // import the client
    #import "FayeClient.h"

    // init the FayeClient with a server and channel to subscribe to
    FayeClient *faye = [[FayeClient alloc] initWithURLString:@"ws://localhost:8000/faye" channel:@"/chat"];
    faye.delegate = self; // ensure that you implement the FayeClientDelegate functions
    // connect to the server
    [faye connectToServer];
  
Implement the FayeClientDelegate:
 
    - (void) messageReceived:(NSDictionary *)messageDict {
      DLog(@"message received");
      // do something useful with the message dictionary    
    }

    - (void)connectedToServer {
      // Faye connection established    
    }

    - (void)disconnectedFromServer {
      // Faye disconnected
    }

Send a message to the Server:
 
    // The message dictionary can be any dictionary structure that you want to send via the connected channel 
    NSDictionary *messageDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Some message text", @"message", @"some meta information", @"meta", nil];
    [faye sendMessage:messageDict];

Using Bayeux Extensions:
 
    // Faye supports extensions to accomplish things like authentication  
    // import the client
    #import "FayeClient.h"

    // init the FayeClient with a server and channel to subscribe to
    FayeClient *faye = [[FayeClient alloc] initWithURLString:@"ws://localhost:8000/faye" channel:@"/chat"];
    faye.delegate = self; // ensure that you implement the FayeClientDelegate functions
  
    // setup the extension and connect to the server
    NSDictionary *ext = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"testing", @"authToken", nil];
    [faye connectToServerWithExt:ext];
        
    // sending an extension with a standard message
    NSDictionary *messageDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Some message text", @"message", @"some meta information", @"meta", nil];
  
    NSDictionary *ext = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"testing", @"authToken", nil];
    [faye sendMessage:messageDict withExt:ext];


Example Project:

Included in the repository is a sample XCode project for Mac that provides a simple client application for interacting with Faye servers.  Try it out and have a look at the code for an illustration on the usage of the library.

The fayeMac sample project allows you to test out any Faye server.

# Development

Want to help us make FayeObjC the best Faye client it can be? Clone, initialize the submodules, and go for it!

    git clone git@github.com:pcrawfor/FayeObjC.git
    cd FayeObjC
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
